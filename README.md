# Numerical Methods Solutions

These are the python solutions for the Numerical Methods Lecture held by Prof. Rezzolla at the Goethe University Frankfurt am Main.

They are an example, how the exercises can be solved and a guide for implementing these algorithms.

I do not recommend to use my algorithms for any scientific work. In python there are already better and well rounded solutions for these problems, see numpy or scipy.
